#random.sample(word, number_of_letters) - helps you choose a set number of letters
#from the word and gives it in a random order 
#join is used to merge those 5 elements and get it as a single word 
#join occurs based on some separater 
#"".join() - means dont see anything but just keep joining the letters without looking 
#for any operator
